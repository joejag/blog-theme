                            <a href="#"><h2 class="article_heading">Agile is more about efficiency then effectiveness</h2></a>
                            <p>At <a href="https://twitter.com/LeanAgileGLA">Lean Agile Glasgow</a> on Wednesday we were discussing a recent event in London where a bunch of agile luminaries got together to discuss <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2013/02/12/henrikkniberg/how-to-build-the-right-thing">&#8220;How to build the right thing&#8221;</a>.</p>
                            <p>The author of the article starts by saying (emphasis mine):</p>
                            <blockquote><p>
                                Agile basically <strong>solved the problem of how to deliver software</strong>. Most any company that applies an agile method and mindset can get working software out the door. Now, <b>the biggest waste in software development seems to be building the wrong product</b>, or the wrong features.
                                </p><small>Henrik Kniberg</small></blockquote>
                                <p>I&#8217;m interpreting this as the author saying that we&#8217;ve figured out how to <em>efficiently</em> create software with agile, but we are still working out  how to <em>effectively</em> deliver it.</p>
                                <p>Reading over the headline statements on the agile manifesto and focusing on the items on the left you will have an efficient system for developing software. But are they focusing on effectiveness?</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br />
                                    <br /><em>Waste reduction by encouraging conversation over heavy process or tools</em></p>
                                    <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation<br />
                                    <br /><em>Waste reduction by building something usable first</em></p>
                                    <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br />
                                    <br /><em>More effectiveness focused than the others here, though also the least adhered too</em></p>
                                    <li>Responding to change over following a plan<br />
                                    <br /><em>Waste reduction by removing detailed future plans that&#8217;ll be wrong or unwanted</em>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Seeing three out of four items as efficiency focused is what leads me to think that agile is more about efficiently than effectiveness. The hope is that by being more effiecient you get more time building valuable and effective software, rather than just doing the wrong thing righter. The area of building the right thing is where we should now focus our efforts.</p>

                                        <p>Hi Joe, to prevent me rambling on at great length, I&#8217;m going to focus on what you said about the Agile manifesto. I think it&#8217;s all in the interpretation you apply to them and the weighting you put on the &#8220;side effects&#8221;.</p>
                                        <p>For example, &#8220;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&#8221; does provide waste reduction by encouraging the conversation. However, that is not the only thing it does. By encouraging the conversation you are also increasing the opportunities for the customer to provide feedback and verify that you *are* building the right thing. </p>
                                        <p>Work Software over docs, yes it reduces waste, but again, it also provides more opportunity for feedback on whether it&#8217;s the right product that is being built.]</p>
                                        <p>I&#8217;ll not list all 4 points you have for brevity, but ultimately I think the same applies to each. You get many things from each of them, but I don&#8217;t think they are easily comparable. </p>
                                        <p>For example, Interactions over Process might provide 16 units of waste reduction, but it also provides 12 points of reviewing the product and backlog. Yes, the numbers are nonsense, but my point is that I&#8217;m not sure you can compare the two (and there are probably other measurements that you could make too). </p>
                                        <p>So I don&#8217;t think the manifesto&#8217;s focus is in the wrong place, I think the people reading it are taking the efficiency values from it more often and perhaps not realising that the other values are also there.</p>

                                        <p>Hi Gordon, thanks for commenting.</p>
                                        <p>I agree with your suggestion about the culture of what people take from the manifesto is mainly efficiency. That&#8217;s a topic for another post.</p>
                                        <p>I believe that most of what you are describing is the benefits of efficiency. With the benefit of not spending so much time on waste activities we get more time to receive feedback from the users as you say. My problem with this is that we could spend a lot of time making a very efficient process using agile, but not actually deliver what was really needed.</p>
                                        <p>Ron Jeffries replied on Twitter saying: &#8220;Agile is mostly about how, not what. Both are needed.&#8221;. That&#8217;s more of less what I&#8217;m saying here too.</p>
                                        <p>Agile has successfully told us &#8216;how&#8217; to build software, we need something else to figure out the &#8216;What&#8217;.</p>
